    <p>Definition: Data Communications describes the degree to which the application
    communicates directly with the processor.
    The data and control information used in the application are sent or received
    over communication facilities. Devices connected locally to the control unit
    are considered to use communication facilities. Protocol is a set of
    conventions that permit the transfer or exchange of information between two
    systems or devices. All data communication links require some type of
    protocol.

        Protocol examples include FTP, dial-up, Token Ring, Ethernet, SNA, TCP/IP,
        IPX/SPX, HTTP, XML, WAP, NTP, ICQ, and NETBEUI. This list should
        not be considered exhaustive.
        The entry of data does not involve reading or writing directly
        to an ILF.
        • Simple business rules and minimal edits (e.g., alpha/numeric,
        range check, required data, etc.) may be performed. When
        this data is eventually processed by the application,
        additional edits are performed.
        The entry of data does not involve reading or writing directly
        to an ILF. Data are entered on-line, but the transactions are
        stored in a temporary file for batch update of ILF(s) at a later
        time.

        • Data for the application is collected and may directly update
        ILF(s) or be stored for future processing using an input
        device, which performs edits based on business rules.

        • Only one communication protocol is used. Typically, when
        this data is processed by the application, no further edits are
        required.

        • The entry of data involves reading or writing to an ILF.

        Remote devices might include a 3270 terminal connected to
        a mainframe computer that allows only simple edits (numeric
        vs. alpha), or printers
